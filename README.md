## EventGo - Scenario Overview Table

\*_For Scenarios with timeout (i.e. Scenario #3), the timeout duration has been reduced to **1 minute** for demonstration purposes. To effectively perform split payment, party member has to pay within 1 min or else split payment will not work. This is set up to demonstrate us triggering the timeout mechanism which will conditionally release Bob's ticket as per video demo._
